# Movies-BTI

## About

Movies-BTI is a web application that defines user's [MBTI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator) personality trait based on dynamically collected user inputs. At the end of the questionnaire, the program recommends a movie genre that most fits the user.

Here is the link to the website.

## Future Improvements / Roadmap

1. Add image files to decorate the result page.
2. More features (currently looking into Netlfix APIs to generate a list of movies in the result page)
3. Incorporate [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for dependency management.

## Miscellaneous

- Pull requests are always welcomed :)
